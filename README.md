User stories are the simple explanation of what is customer trying to accomplish with the software. User stories help the developing team understand 
what they are building and how that feature is going to help the end-user. Collaboration is the key factor that helps Scrum Team succeed in the project
because they colectively help each other to achieve a unified goal that is the Product goal. To be a good member of a software development team, each 
individual should take their task seriously, take responsibility for their action, and help and support their team members.
